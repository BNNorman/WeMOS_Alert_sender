# WeMOS_Alert_sender
A WeMOS D1 MIni used to fire alert messages when a button is pressed

Basically something my Mum can press to send an alert email to me when she is in trouble.

I fitted this inside a big red button I bought off Amazon. You could make your own button as long as you have two AAA cells to give between 2.5V and 3.3V.

Here's the schematic for the PCB. I haven't design a PCB for it since it's a one off prototype.

The Arduino sketch for it is included.

Enjoy.
